# baymax3.0

A simple chatbot built from scratch using PyTorch.

## Overview

This is a chatbot implementation using PyTorch that demonstrates the fundamentals of NLP-based conversational AI. The project is structured using `.py` files rather than notebooks to facilitate easier function imports and code organization.

## Core Components

The chatbot is built using three fundamental NLP techniques:

1. **Tokenization** - Breaking down text into individual tokens
2. **Stemming** - Reducing words to their root form
3. **Bag of Words** - Converting text into numerical feature vectors

```

## Implementation Details

- Built entirely in **PyTorch**
- Modular Python files (`.py` format) for easy function importing
- Clean, reusable code structure

## About the Code

The codebase contains various internal jokes and references that can be modified according to the reader's preference. Feel free to customize the responses and personality of the chatbot!
